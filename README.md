# Spring-Boot

This uses the prebuilt configuration of Spring Initializr. Apart from prebuilt dependencies and the actual full setup of Spring Boot, everything else was coded from scratch.

To run Spring Boot as it uses Spring Initializr setup, run ./mvnw spring-boot:run in the terminal (or IDE terminal).
